spells\n\nSpells which do not use a cooldown, but use charges instead, which replenish over time. Spells using this system are:\n\n#####By default:\n\n1. Spin Web\n2. Spirit Siphon\n3. Stone Remnant\n4. Fire Remnant\n5. Leap\n6. Shrapnel\n\n#####With Aghanim's Scepter:\n\n1. Rupture (requires aghs)\n2. Astral Imprisonment (requires aghs)\n3. Demonic Purge (requires aghs)\n\n#####With a talent:\n\n1. Sleight of Fist (requires talent)\n2. Homing  Missile (requires talent)\n3. Waveform (requires talent)\n4. Disruption (requires talent)\n5. Toss (requires talent)\n\n---\n---\n\nLet's start with how charge-based spells are displayed in-game currently. Everyone knows that they use a permanent status buff with a number on it showing the current charges. The \"expiring\" of the status buff represents the recharge time of the charges, which looks like this\n\n[current Morphling example] (https://i.imgur.com/RlIukJl.png)\n\n---\n\n# Visual rework\n\nInstead of using a permanent status buff, add a custom HUD element for charge-based spells. For example, a bar next to the ability which displays the current recharge time and shows the amount of available charges.\n\n[Example of a charge bar] (https://i.imgur.com/uplTROz.png)\n\nThis is just a quick example. What I did here is\n\n1. Removed the charge counter buffs completely.\n2. Added space between the abilities to make room.\n3. Added a bar to the right of the charge-based spell.\n4. A number plate at the top and bottom of the bar to show current charges (top)/recharge time (bottom)\n5. Options for the bar: Either make it one solid bar filling up for each recharge, or split the bar up based on the number of max charges the spell can have.\n6. When at 0 charges, the ability turns dark (inactive), instead of going on cooldown (currently, they go on cooldown, which causes issues as well)\n7. When trying to cast while at 0 charges, it gives \"No charges\" error message (currently, it uses the default cooldown error message)\n\n[example 1, Full charges] (https://i.imgur.com/BW53u2k.png)\n\n[example 2, 1 charge ready, 1 recharging] (https://i.imgur.com/SNnOztq.png)\n\n[example 3, no charge ready, 1 recharging] (https://i.imgur.com/4Sk3R3i.png)\n\n---\n\n#Reasonings\n\nThere are several reasons why the use of a regular status buff is bad, for the player, and for the devs when it comes to updating or adding more charge-based spells:\n\n1. The charge counter buffs are out of place in the STATUS bar, since they aren't really a status effect (like a disable or damage over time), or an ongoing spell that just gets cast (e.g. teleports, rearm or Epicenter).\n2. Since they are PERMANENT status buffs, they reduce the space in the status bar permanently for the hero. Some heroes can even have 2 of them (ember and shadow demon). They are clogging up the status bar.\n3. The duration of status buffs/debuffs are indicated by a depleting green/red ring around the icons. This is unfitting for a recharge time, where a filling effect would make more sense, and not a depleting effect.\n4. The status buffs reveal information to the enemy. There's a reason why enemies can't see your spells' current cooldowns. Meanwhile, charge-based spells are fully revealed. The enemy knows how many charges you have and when your next charge will be ready, by just checking the charge counter in your status bar.\n5. Since they technically are \"regular status buffs\" (a modifier), they behave as such as well. Each modifier is coded separately, so whenever a new charge-based spell gets added, it may have its own new bugs which others don't (you can see some examples later in the bugs section). This also makes it more tedious to update them if things change, since you'd have to go through all of them one by one.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Bugs\n\n---\n---\n\n# Inifinte charges abuse\n\nNot gonna say how it's done here. All I'll say is that this bug exists because charge-based spells use a regular status buff/modifier to keep track of the charges\n\nFor the devs, all you need to know is [in this thread on the  devs forum] (https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=287690).\n\n---\n\n# Supernova and Rearm don't replenish charges\n\nSome time ago, charge-based spells were made to get refreshed by Refresher Orb. Supernova and Rearm, still can't replenish charges. If you have 0 charges, they do refresh the \"cooldown\", but you don't get the charges back.\n\nThey should replenish charges as well.\n\n[Video demo Rearm] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4Ze7DmO75g)\n\n[Video demo Supernova] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDIYd0JdT5Q) (ignore the part showing charged-based ults, I forgot Supernova doesn't refresh ultimates)\n\n---\n\n# Time Dilation &amp; Chakra Magic interaction with charge-based spells\n\n**Time Dilation**'s behavior with charge-based spells is really bad. It either does nothing at all, or causes charge-based spells to desynchronize with their charges.\n\n**Chakra Magic** doesn't affect charge-based spells at all (in regular matches), but does react on them. The cooldown reduction triggers when using charge-based spells, so that it's used up, but it doesn't reduce the recharge time at all. It gets fully wasted. If you have -wtf/free spells mode on, it does reduce the cooldown when used while at 0 charges, so that the spell itself is ready before a charge is.\n\n**Repro (Time Dilation):**\n\n1. Pick any hero which has a charge-based spell and an create an enemy void\n2. Use up all charges on the spell, so the \"cooldown\" gets displayed\n3. Get hit by enemy Time Dilation\n4. Wait until having 1 charge again\n\n**Result:** Time Dilation pauses the \"cooldown\", causing it to desync with the recharge timer. The actual recharge timer is unaffected.\n\n**Expected:** If a charge is recharging, Time Dilation should increase its recharge time as well.\n\n**Repro (Chakra Magic):**\n\n1. Pick any hero which has a charge-based spell and an create an allied Kotl\n2. Have the Kotl cast Chakra Magic on you\n3. Use your charge-based spell once.\n4. Check its recharge time and compare it to a cast without Chakra Magic\n\n**Result:** Chakra Magic did nothing to the recharge time at all. But it did use up its cooldown reduction, so if you'd use another spell, that spell does not have its cooldown reduced. If you do this in -wtf mode, and use up your last charge, it does reduce the cooldown, but not the recharge time, so that the spell is ready before a charge is ready.\n\n**Expected:** Chakra Magic should affect charge-based spells, reducing their recharge time. \n\n[video demo Time Dilation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTeOU8CbwSQ)\n\n[video demo Chakra Magic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8RV9NC-JM)\n\n---\n\n# A lot of charge-based spells allow targeting even when at 0 charges \n\nAnother flaw with the current charges system. It doesn't prevent spells from being cast while at 0 charges. This safety check instead has to be manually coded into every charge-based spell individually.\n\nSleight of Fist, Leap and Waveform don't have a safety check at all, so you can cast them with 0 spells when resetting the cooldown (which is another flaw, them using a regular cooldown for this).\n\nRupture, Demonic Purge, Astral Imprisonment and Spirit Siphon are not working properly either. Instead of completely disallowing targeting a unit, they allow targeting and then give the error message afterwards.\n\nSpells which do it correctly are: Homing Missile, Disruption, Spin Web, Stone Remnant, Fire Remnant, Shrapnell and Toss\n\n[video demo, ground targeted spells] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCfgNbIldqE)\n\n[video demo, single target spells] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GmuEgMRVI4)\n\n---\n\n# Stone Remnant &amp; Fire Remnant charge counters disappear when using up all charges\n\nAnother flaw caused by the fact that each charge counter buff is coded individually. The counters of Stone Remnant and Fire Remnant fully disappear when at 0 charges. No other charge-based spell's counter does this.\n\n[video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfjFhVlhDfM)\n\n---\n\n# Spell charges granted by Aghs or Talents do not have infinite charges in wtf mode\n\nAnother flaw. The infinite charges in -wtf mode only affects spells which have charges by default. Spells which get their charges via talents of Aghanim's Scepter don't have infinite charges in -wtf mode.\n\n[video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKc98emR0SY)\n\n---\n\n# Charge counter buffs of Shrapnel and Leap (and Waveform) invisible for Rubick/Morphling\n\nWhen you copy Shrapnel or Leap, you don't see the charge counter buff at all. It is hidden when copied. Waveform is technically affected, too, but no one can copy talents, so it currently doesn't matter.\n\nThe buff should be visible\n\n[image] (https://i.imgur.com/uJwygV9.jpg)\n\n---\n\n# Shrapnel's, Spin Web's and Stone Remnant's error messages are broken\n\nShrapnel and Spin Web how \"CUSTOM ERROR\" instead of their proper \"no Shrapnel/Spin Web charges\" error messages.\n\nStone Remnant's error message calls the spell \"Stone Caller\" instead of \"Stone Remnant\".\n\n[video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Nnwo9O9LA)\n\n---\n\n# Some tooltips stuff\n\nThe way tooltips display charges is very inconsistent currently. Some spells have unnecessary  charges text in the main description, some spells have no info about charges at all and some spells don't tell you their recharge time or max charges.\n\n[ability tooltips, current compared to fixed] (https://i.imgur.com/PQtpBD7.jpg)\n\n[charge counter buff tooltips, current and fixed] (https://i.imgur.com/hgQo7hM.jpg)\n\n[talent descriptions, current and fixed] (https://i.imgur.com/EXw3rJM.jpg)\n\nList of changes:\n\n1.

Everyone knows that they use a permanent status buff with a number on it showing the current charges. The &amp;quot;expiring&amp;quot; of the status buff represents the recharge time of the charges, which looks like this&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/RlIukJl.png\"&gt;current Morphling example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Visual rework&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of using a permanent status buff, add a custom HUD element for charge-based spells. For example, a bar next to the ability which displays the current recharge time and shows the amount of available charges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/uplTROz.png\"&gt;Example of a charge bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick example. What I did here is&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Removed the charge counter buffs completely.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added space between the abilities to make room.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added a bar to the right of the charge-based spell.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A number plate at the top and bottom of the bar to show current charges (top)/recharge time (bottom)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Options for the bar: Either make it one solid bar filling up for each recharge, or split the bar up based on the number of max charges the spell can have.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When at 0 charges, the ability turns dark (inactive), instead of going on cooldown (currently, they go on cooldown, which causes issues as well)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When trying to cast while at 0 charges, it gives &amp;quot;No charges&amp;quot; error message (currently, it uses the default cooldown error message)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BW53u2k.png\"&gt;example 1, Full charges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/SNnOztq.png\"&gt;example 2, 1 charge ready, 1 recharging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4Sk3R3i.png\"&gt;example 3, no charge ready, 1 recharging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Reasonings&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why the use of a regular status buff is bad, for the player, and for the devs when it comes to updating or adding more charge-based spells:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The charge counter buffs are out of place in the STATUS bar, since they aren&amp;#39;t really a status effect (like a disable or damage over time), or an ongoing spell that just gets cast (e.g. teleports, rearm or Epicenter).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since they are PERMANENT status buffs, they reduce the space in the status bar permanently for the hero. Some heroes can even have 2 of them (ember and shadow demon). They are clogging up the status bar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The duration of status buffs/debuffs are indicated by a depleting green/red ring around the icons. This is unfitting for a recharge time, where a filling effect would make more sense, and not a depleting effect.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The status buffs reveal information to the enemy. There&amp;#39;s a reason why enemies can&amp;#39;t see your spells&amp;#39; current cooldowns. Meanwhile, charge-based spells are fully revealed. The enemy knows how many charges you have and when your next charge will be ready, by just checking the charge counter in your status bar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since they technically are &amp;quot;regular status buffs&amp;quot; (a modifier), they behave as such as well. Each modifier is coded separately, so whenever a new charge-based spell gets added, it may have its own new bugs which others don&amp;#39;t (you can see some examples later in the bugs section). This also makes it more tedious to update them if things change, since you&amp;#39;d have to go through all of them one by one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Inifinte charges abuse&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not gonna say how it&amp;#39;s done here. All I&amp;#39;ll say is that this bug exists because charge-based spells use a regular status buff/modifier to keep track of the charges&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the devs, all you need to know is &lt;a href=\"https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=287690\"&gt;in this thread on the  devs forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Supernova and Rearm don&amp;#39;t replenish charges&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, charge-based spells were made to get refreshed by Refresher Orb. Supernova and Rearm, still can&amp;#39;t replenish charges. If you have 0 charges, they do refresh the &amp;quot;cooldown&amp;quot;, but you don&amp;#39;t get the charges back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They should replenish charges as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4Ze7DmO75g\"&gt;Video demo Rearm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDIYd0JdT5Q\"&gt;Video demo Supernova&lt;/a&gt; (ignore the part showing charged-based ults, I forgot Supernova doesn&amp;#39;t refresh ultimates)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Time Dilation &amp;amp; Chakra Magic interaction with charge-based spells&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Dilation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s behavior with charge-based spells is really bad. It either does nothing at all, or causes charge-based spells to desynchronize with their charges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chakra Magic&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t affect charge-based spells at all (in regular matches), but does react on them. The cooldown reduction triggers when using charge-based spells, so that it&amp;#39;s used up, but it doesn&amp;#39;t reduce the recharge time at all. It gets fully wasted. If you have -wtf/free spells mode on, it does reduce the cooldown when used while at 0 charges, so that the spell itself is ready before a charge is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repro (Time Dilation):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick any hero which has a charge-based spell and an create an enemy void&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use up all charges on the spell, so the &amp;quot;cooldown&amp;quot; gets displayed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get hit by enemy Time Dilation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wait until having 1 charge again&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; Time Dilation pauses the &amp;quot;cooldown&amp;quot;, causing it to desync with the recharge timer. The actual recharge timer is unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected:&lt;/strong&gt; If a charge is recharging, Time Dilation should increase its recharge time as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repro (Chakra Magic):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick any hero which has a charge-based spell and an create an allied Kotl&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have the Kotl cast Chakra Magic on you&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use your charge-based spell once.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check its recharge time and compare it to a cast without Chakra Magic&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; Chakra Magic did nothing to the recharge time at all. But it did use up its cooldown reduction, so if you&amp;#39;d use another spell, that spell does not have its cooldown reduced. If you do this in -wtf mode, and use up your last charge, it does reduce the cooldown, but not the recharge time, so that the spell is ready before a charge is ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected:&lt;/strong&gt; Chakra Magic should affect charge-based spells, reducing their recharge time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTeOU8CbwSQ\"&gt;video demo Time Dilation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8RV9NC-JM\"&gt;video demo Chakra Magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A lot of charge-based spells allow targeting even when at 0 charges&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another flaw with the current charges system. It doesn&amp;#39;t prevent spells from being cast while at 0 charges. This safety check instead has to be manually coded into every charge-based spell individually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleight of Fist, Leap and Waveform don&amp;#39;t have a safety check at all, so you can cast them with 0 spells when resetting the cooldown (which is another flaw, them using a regular cooldown for this).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rupture, Demonic Purge, Astral Imprisonment and Spirit Siphon are not working properly either. Instead of completely disallowing targeting a unit, they allow targeting and then give the error message afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spells which do it correctly are: Homing Missile, Disruption, Spin Web, Stone Remnant, Fire Remnant, Shrapnell and Toss&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCfgNbIldqE\"&gt;video demo, ground targeted spells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GmuEgMRVI4\"&gt;video demo, single target spells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Stone Remnant &amp;amp; Fire Remnant charge counters disappear when using up all charges&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another flaw caused by the fact that each charge counter buff is coded individually. The counters of Stone Remnant and Fire Remnant fully disappear when at 0 charges. No other charge-based spell&amp;#39;s counter does this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfjFhVlhDfM\"&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Spell charges granted by Aghs or Talents do not have infinite charges in wtf mode&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another flaw. The infinite charges in -wtf mode only affects spells which have charges by default. Spells which get their charges via talents of Aghanim&amp;#39;s Scepter don&amp;#39;t have infinite charges in -wtf mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKc98emR0SY\"&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Charge counter buffs of Shrapnel and Leap (and Waveform) invisible for Rubick/Morphling&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you copy Shrapnel or Leap, you don&amp;#39;t see the charge counter buff at all. It is hidden when copied. Waveform is technically affected, too, but no one can copy talents, so it currently doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The buff should be visible&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/uJwygV9.jpg\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Shrapnel&amp;#39;s, Spin Web&amp;#39;s and Stone Remnant&amp;#39;s error messages are broken&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shrapnel and Spin Web how &amp;quot;CUSTOM ERROR&amp;quot; instead of their proper &amp;quot;no Shrapnel/Spin Web charges&amp;quot; error messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stone Remnant&amp;#39;s error message calls the spell &amp;quot;Stone Caller&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Stone Remnant&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Nnwo9O9LA\"&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Some tooltips stuff&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way tooltips display charges is very inconsistent currently.

I’d like to acknowledge that, while there have been concerns about the quality of the winning game, I'd like to focus on the process that got us to this point instead of the game that won.\n\nLet’s start from the beginning\n\nSeptember 17, 2017- Valve announces their competition. All of the developers think its going to be great so we all get to work immediately, since 2 months is not alot of time. However, there are huge issues in the rules, like\n\n* There is no grading criteria published whatsoever. How are we supposed to know how good our games are? Does art matter alot or is gameplay the only thing we should be focusing on? Do we have to worry about players on the Arcade or is it quality based only? (This mattered a lot for us, our game requires 10 people playing at the same skill level to be extremely enjoyable). How closely do we follow Frostivus existing/new lore?\n\n* What does “No third party assets” mean? Does this mean we can’t use completely open source code like literally every mod on the workshop does (Lua, JS (the languages you MUST use to build your mod) are third party assets!!!!) (Even the winning entry used third party assets! He let them know and they got permission from the owners to use them even when they were open source, but still this is completely neglectful)\n\n* Tons of other issues like not being able to submit contributors or dedicated servers working or there being existing mods given Frostivus tags\n\nWe emailed. Over, and over, and over. I personally sent 3 to every Valve address I know and got nothing back ever. These are ESSENTIAL RULE CLARIFICATIONS. There is absolutely no excuse for a professional contest with 30K on the line to not have rule clarifications.\n\nPast that, there's two months of people working hard, with the deadline extension and stuff which I’m going to skip since it’s controversial\n\nNow comes the legendary Valve Email that was sent to two of us that I’d like to talk about for a little while.\n\nPast the deadline of November 24th, Valve never locked the mods! So we could still update them and do whatever to them. Considering Valve didn’t seem very organized, noone had faith that they took copies of mods on the deadline for judging instead of just downloading them whatever (which they didn’t in the end). This was SUPER important, because people were literally still adding content past the deadline! So you created this divide between people who were creating content past the deadline to get an advantage and those who followed the rules. After 17 emails, Valve finally responded a week after the deadline, saying\n\n&gt; Regarding your ... question about updates, bugfixes can still be submitted, but are not guaranteed to be included in the review process.\n\nThis is probably the worst answer in the history of Valve answers that was ever given.\n\n* This was not sent out as an official answer to anyone, only over email to 2 (known) people. This is an incredibily important topic to all modders yet they couldn’t even make a solid answer on this.\n\n* What is a bug fix? Does “Fixed a bug where the final boss didn’t exist” count as a bug fix? Are we going to be disqualified if we submit something that YOU consider isn’t a bug fix? Are the people who updated before hand going to be disqualified? What does ANY of this mean?\n\n* What does “not guaranteed” mean? Does this mean you’re just hapazardly downloading games off of the workshop and playing them as is? This actually introduces RNG to who wins the prize! Two people just fixed crucial bugs to their game, but valve played one before the crucial bug was fixed and one after, so the one afterwards won. How is that remotely fair?\n\nNeedless to say, the entire community was livid and up in arms about this, but we heard literally nothing back.\n\nTalking about the selection process for a bit, a few days later Valve sends out this gem of a facebook post https://www.facebook.com/dota2/posts/1707884899276960\n\nThis directly states that subscriber count is a factor for judging! What a disaster!\n\nThe entire community became this clusterfuck of a race to beg all the big YouTubers to play their games, and everyone kept breaking the bugfix rule too to add new content and whatnot to get active players so it just became an absolute disaster.\n\nThe final winner?\n\nThe one to rule them all?\n\nFrostivus festival.\n\nNo coincidence,\n\n* Played by bulldog 3 times and had 2  (3?) separate videos about it to boost player count, when all other mods had 1 at best\n* #1 on the subscriber counts out of all of the mods that were legal (Feastivus was higher but had copyright issues, some other mods were higher but were just old mods tagged with frostivus)\n\nI don't have to break it down that Valve obviously just grabbed the one with the most players.\n\nAdditionally, it broke the rules of third party content (discussed earlier) (Thankfully did not abuse the bugfix loophole too heavily but that loophole was still a huge issue for us)\n\n\nRegardless of what you think of the mod, consider this- there is no second, third, or whatever place mod. Noone besides this one mod received anything at all from the contest, not even feedback from Valve.\n\nLastly, Valve doesn’t have the guts to come answer up and talk about their judging process or how they felt that all of their competition was\n\n&gt; Thank you to all of the contributors who worked hard to help make this contest a resounding success.\n\nI really feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment from this contest.\n\nCustom games are over with this.
